# Laskowski-Lab

Our research investigates the causes and consequences of behavioral diversity and plasticity. We explore how evolution has shaped the developmental processes that generate behavioral variation. 

Our goal is to understand how individuals integrate cues from their genes, parents and experiences to build their phenotypes from both ultimate and proximate perspectives.
